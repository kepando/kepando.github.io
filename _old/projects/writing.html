        <h1>Examples of Technical Writing</h1>
        <p>The examples below are from WR227, taken at Portland Community College, where I invented hypothetical companies, products, and people to illustrate scenarios in which technical writing is useful. I plan to make links for the examples, then explain what I enjoyed about the assignments and why I could write technically for a living.</p>
