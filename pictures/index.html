          <p>A couple things about this picture I usedon my LinkedIn page: 
          <br>I'm always wearing my facial hair and head hair differenly, so I made a profile picture that I could re-crop to match how I'm currently looking (don't want to surprise any employers by showing up with completely differnt look than they're expecting.)
          <br>
          Next thing, I don't like when people use selfies for their profile pics on LinkedIn. So, I Google'd around and found a good picutre of a "Tech Office Hallway" to use as the background for my profile pic.
          <br><br>
          How It Was Made:
          <br>
          I used photoshop to try and match the tones of my selfies to that of the Google stock hallway photo. Then I used Enlight app to lay the selfie over the hallway photo. And finally, I used Pic Stitch to make a 4x4 picture that could be resized whenever I need to rock a new look.
